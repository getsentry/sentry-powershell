PowerShell Sentry SDK is a thin wrapper on top of [Sentry .NET SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet) with some quality of life improvements for PowerShell users.
Although the underlying .NET SDK is proven in production, the PowerShell Sentry SDK is in its very early stages and is not recommended for production use.

## Compatiblity

The PowerShell Sentry SDK is tested to work with:

- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- PowerShell 7.2+ on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Documentation

Sentry has extensive documentation for its SDKs on docs.sentry.io:

- [PowerShell SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/powershell/)
- [.NET SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/)
